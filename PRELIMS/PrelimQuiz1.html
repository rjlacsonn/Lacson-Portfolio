            <h2><i>Pililla Wind Farm: Where Renewable Energy Meets Breathtaking Views</i></h2>

            <p>This is the <b>Wind Farm in Rizal</b>. Located in the humble <b>Barangay of Halayhayin</b> in Pililla, to be more precise, the Rizal Wind Farm is the newest addition to the growing list of tourism hotspots within close proximity of the capital, just two hours away from Manila.</p>
            
            <p>Construction of the Pililla Wind Farm in Rizal, Philippines began on <b>June 18, 2013</b>, and it was commissioned in <b>2016</b>. The Alternergy Philippine Holdings Corporation <b>(APHC)</b> owns and operates the farm. The farm consists of 27 wind turbine generators grouped into three clusters with an aggregate capacity of 54MW.  To fund the project, Alternergy encouraged three local banks to form a syndicate. Also, the consortium offered 105M pesos in project financing.</p>

            <p>This is my memorable place because this is my first time that I saw a windmill. My friends also accompanied me and because of our experience here was memorable. The air in this place seems to help to wash away your tiredness and it will help you to think better about the problems you are carrying.</p>
